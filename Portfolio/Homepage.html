                <p>My name is Karina, I was born on March 19, 2000. I guess that makes me 19 years old,<br>
                    there are a few things that you'll learn about me throughout my portfolio:<br>
                    <br>
                    What I see myself doing in the future? <br>
                    I would really like to program apps and make an game from scratch.<br>
                    You know really use my imagination and make the pictures in my head come to life.<br>
                    Afther APM I would really like to specialise in Cyber Crime.
                </p>
                <p>I created a digital component together with a project group.<br>
                    In short what the component does is: You can count the rounds, keep <br>
                    track of the players health and shield points, randomize a airdrop and roll<br>
                    the dice with it. <a class="link" href="images/digitale_component.pdf"> (see picture)</a>
